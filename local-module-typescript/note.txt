This is an example of npm custom package which can be loaded from local directories


To istall the local package defined in this directory we have to run the followin command

npm install --save ../local-module-typescript

This command needs to be run from the directory of the module which wants to install this package, in this example
such directory is 
./node-typescript

This is a good article that explains the steps to create an npm package from typescript

Key things to consider

index.ts
create an index.ts that defines what the package exports

tsconfig.json
make sure that "declaration" property is set to true, so that index.d.ts is generated automatically
    "declaration": true,

package.json
make sure that 
    "main": "dist/index.js",
    "types" : "dist/index.d.ts",


any time the package is changed, make sure you run the command
    npm install --save ../local-module-typescript
from within the directory containing the project that imports the local module
