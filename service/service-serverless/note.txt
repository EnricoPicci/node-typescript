this package implements a service using serverless-framework

it imports an external package (local in our case) where interfaces are defined so that they can be shared also with the clients
Interfaces can be implemented as TypeScript Interfaces or Classes
In the service-interface package we define also any function which may be used both by server and client (e.g. validators)
Whoever is the owner of the service is owner and needs to define the service-interface package

Scafold directories for a node typescript package
- create the directory for the package
- from the package directory run "npm init" to create a default package.json
- run "npm i typescript --save-dev" to install the packages needed to debug and run tests on node typescript apps
- Install Serveless Typescript Plugin in the "service-serverless" directory with the command
    "yarn add --dev serverless-plugin-typescript"

NOTE: there is no need to configure tsconfig.json since the serverless-plugin-typescript has its own default typescript configuration

- The top directory "service-serverless" will hold only the packages used for development (i.e. the ones stored in "devDependencies"
  of "package.json"). This is to avoid to put in the build distribution folder the packages used only for development, see
  http://www.goingserverless.com/blog/keeping-dev-dependencies-out-of-your-serverless-package
- From within the directory "service-serverless" scaffold the project with the serverless framework command
    "serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path functions-aws"
  this command creates the directory "functions-aws" with the initial scaffolding

Operations to be performed from within the directory "functions-aws"
- Create a directory "node_modules" - the deploy command require such a directory even if it is empty
- Import the "service-interface" package with the command
    "npm install --save ../../service-interface"
- run "npm init" to create a default package.json file
- Add in the "serverless.yml" file of the directory "functions-aws" the configuration
plugins:
  - serverless-plugin-typescript

- In the "serverless.yml" file of the directory "functions-aws" make sure that the functions are correctly defined with their events, such as
functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - http:
          path: hello/get
          method: get

- Rename handler.js to handler.ts
- Replace in "handler.ts" the js code with valid typescript code


- Go to directory "functions-aws" and from theere compile typescript and deploy the code with the command
    "serverless deploy"
